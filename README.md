# My Junk Drawer

Just personal stuff I want saved or under source control. I attempted to keep things organized incase you'd like to use any of it or snoop.

`bin/` files are either binaries (most likely compiled with Linux x86_64), a bash script, or python script that is expected to be `chmod +x` and in your `PATH`.
